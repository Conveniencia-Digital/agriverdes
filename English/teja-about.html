	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>Teja Tscharntke is a professor of Agroecology at the University of Göttingen, Germany. His research focuses on biodiversity patterns and associated ecosystem functioning at different spatial and temporal scales and in managed and natural systems. Field studies are based in tropical and temperate regions, comparing food webs and multitrophic interactions, but he is also interested in multidisciplinary studies linking socioeconomic with ecological approaches. In the Agroecology Group, many people are working on a number of collaborative projects – often aiming at potential tradeoffs between viable land-use systems and biodiversity conservation in human-dominated, fragmented landscapes. Recent first-author papers focus on ‘Landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns and processes – eight hypotheses’ (2012, Biol. Rev.) and ‘Global food security, biodiversity conservation and the future of agricultural intensification’ (2012, Biol. Conserv.).</p>
