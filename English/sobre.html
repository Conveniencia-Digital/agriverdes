	There is a great amount of knowledge and information generated by researchers of agro-ecological basis, from farmers daily experiences (rural and urban) as well as other professionals from different fields, who support to the great diversity of successfull initiatives in Brazil and all over the world.
However, the accessibility to this qualified information to support the Agro-ecology and Permaculture development still really restricted given the difficulty to participate in collective activities such as congresses, seminars, courses, among others, usually “face-to-face”.
It is in this context that the Agriverdes Institute holds the 2nd AgroecoWeb – International congress Online in Agro-ecology and Permaculture, from 4th to 10th October 2017. This is the World Unprecedented Brazilian Initiative.
The 2nd AgroecoWeb event will provide lectures on great relevance subjects, besides two courses that will be provided in vídeo lessons during the event.
We are honored to have, in this HUGE EVENT, several experts in Agro-ecology and Permaculture coming from several parts of the world, that will be responsable for the lectures and curses.
