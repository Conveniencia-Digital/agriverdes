Dears,

I=E2=80=99m Louise, I work with Fran=C3=A7ois. We thank your for your =
request. It=E2=80=99s a pleasure to be known like that !
Fran=C3=A7ois would be glad to send you a speech but needs clarification =
to send something.

First, even if our job is in a global aspect, as permaculture is, our =
knowledges and added value are more about agriculture (a part of =
permaculture).
The job is about creating numeric training / courses about conservation =
agriculture : the preservation of the soils by the non-working/labour + =
rebuilding of the biological activities.
As you can see, we are very specifics on the field of taking care of =
soils. Then, we work on technological tools.

So, if it is ok for your that he send you a subject on one of these =
thematics, we need 2 answers :
- when do you want the sending ?
- are you ok for a powerpoint (slides with pictures / diagrams ) + voice =
?

Thank you for your answers,

All the best,

Louise
